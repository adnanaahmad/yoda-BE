    #### Use the BAV (Bank Account Verification) API to ensure the person has access to the bank account they claim they do.
    <br/>
    <p>All our API products use mutual TLS and require the proper <b>client certificates</b> which are typically different for each environment.</p>    
    <br/>
    <p>This service has a UI for testing here (requires the client certificates): <br/><a href="https://api-uat.fortifid.com/v1/bav/" target="_blank">https://api-uat.fortifid.com/v1/bav/</a>.
